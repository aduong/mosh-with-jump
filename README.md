# mosh-with-jump

## Summary

mosh-with-jump is a [Mosh](https://mosh.org) wrapper that supports a single
jump/proxy server like `ssh -J $jump_server`. It does so by starting
`mosh-server` on the target server via the jump server and then proxying UDP
packets through the proxy server.

## Examples

Using a jump server

    ./mosh-with-jump -J $jump_server $destination

Using a jump server with ProxyJump in .ssh/config

    ./mosh-with-jump $destination

With ports specified (for the target server)

    ./mosh-with-jump -p 61000:61100 -J $jump_server $destination

Using no jump server (just calls `mosh`)
    
    ./mosh-with-jump $destination
    
## Requirements

mosh-with-jump was written with some portability in mind and uses some fairly
common Unix utilities. All machines involved must have SSH. Only the client and
target machines need to have Mosh. The proxy server uses socat to proxy and ss
to query for in-use ports.
